Yes, it appears to be a trojan downloader and has a detection ratio of 35/54.

Using PEView and checking the section headers, we can see that they are labelled UPX, which implies the have been packed using UPX, and the Raw data size is smaller than the virtual size, which indicates that the executable is packed. Specifically the size of the virtual and raw data for each UPX package is 4000 and 0, 1000 and 600, and 1000 and 200. I was also given a warning by IDAPro that said that the import segment seems to be destroyed, and that this may mean the file has been packed or otherwise modified to make it more difficult to analyse. PEiD cannot recognize that the executable is packed, so we use UPX to check. 

3. WININET is imported and InternetOpen and InternetOpenUrl are used, so the executable is able to access the internet. The program also imports ADAVAPI32 uses CreateService, so we know that the program will create a service that will perform some function. All of the other functions are ubiquitous to nearly all programs, so I can't come to a conclusion about how the executable will act based on them. So we can tell that the malware will download something form the internet, and create a service.

 If you look at the Strings of the executable you can the name MalService and the url http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com. You can attempt to identify infected machines by checking whether or nnot they have a service MalService. You can also check if a machine or group of machines is affected by seeing if there is any traffic to or from the IP associated with malwareanalysisbook.com.
